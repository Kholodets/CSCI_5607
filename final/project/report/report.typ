For this assignment I implemented a simple game engine to play a maze/door+key game. It supports all the basic features in addition to proper mouse looking with WASD movement. I also have recorded a video demoing the functionality.

I'm turning this in on Sunday, so I'm aiming for 90% (80% basic features + 5% mouse/kb input + 5% video demo).

My code is all in `game.cpp`, I used the SDL3 version of last weeks homework as basis.

#figure(
html.elem("video", attrs: (controls: "", width: "600"))[
  #html.elem("source", attrs: (src: "images/demo.webm", type: "video/webm"))[]
],
caption: [demo video]
)

#html.elem("a", attrs:(href: "macle119_proj4.tar.gz"))[macle119_proj4.tar.gz]
